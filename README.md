# Planova

A future proof opinionated software to manage your life in plaintext : todo, agenda, journal and notes.

By using a more structured yet flexible approach with dailies Markdown files instead of a calendar.txt and todo.txt, Planova provides a more efficient, scalable, and user-friendly experience compared to MOrg.
